    <br>
   <p>This page is dedicated to my works I have completed in my Computer Science classes. :p</p>
   <p>These are certificates that I have completed from the Code Academy website. Impressed?</p>

    <p>This certificate was earned via the hour of code website. I learned and made a small app with the</p>
    <p>Applab program, it was very enlightening for me, and has me interested in creating my own app.</p>

    <p>I love the game, and I love this programming spinoff. It was a basic command drag and drop to give out commands</p>
    <p>in this pretty, blocky game.</p>
    
    <p>Click the following screenshots to check out my simple scratch projects.</p>

      <p>First Project. This simple project was one of my first, I created it with the help menu I tried out at home.</p>
      <p>This was where I learned how to input commands through keystrokes or clicks.</p>

       <p>Second Project. This is a collaboration with my classmate, Jonathan. We worked on a little story about</p>
       <p>the Scratch cat running to a magic carpet while on the run from scrolling wolves.</p>

        <p>Third Project. This project consisted of using the broadcasting command. This command broadcasts a figurative "signal", and when</p>
        <p>other parts of the program recieve this program, it allows other commands to be executed, and it saves time.</p>

        <p>Fourth Project. This is my interactive fiction work from the Python coding language. You choose between both choices as you navigate</p>
        <p>throughout the story. Can you make it to the end?</p>
