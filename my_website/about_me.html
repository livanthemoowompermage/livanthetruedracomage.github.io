    <h1>About Me</h1> <br>
    <p> Welcome to the About Me section!</a>
    
       <p> I am a senior at the STEM Boyle Heights high school. I enjoy working with computers and plants.</p>
    <p> My future goal and/or career is to either be a computer programmer or an agronomist.</p>
    <p> I am determined to achieve this, anyone can be anything they want, if they believe and can afford it. :)</p>
    <p> Remember, if you give up, you give up on yourself.</p>
